This repository showcases the wedding e-card I designed and developed entirely in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

### Overview

My goal was to create a unique and personal digital invitation that reflects the joy of our special day while ensuring seamless performance and a responsive design. 

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures beautiful rendering across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Custom CSS Animations**: Achieves a delicate falling petals effect through pure CSS, enhancing the visual experience without relying on any external libraries.

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Implements all interactivity using modern, efficient JavaScript techniques, avoiding jQuery to maintain a lightweight footprint.
